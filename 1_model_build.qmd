##### **What is a random forest?**

- Bootstrap samples - samples drawn with replacements for each tree built in the ensemble within the training dataset - introducing randomness into the samples
- Two main types as classifier & regressor with differences e.g. class labels (binary) or continuous variables
- L. Breiman's papers in 1998 & 2001
- Look into random forest regression particularly


Draft plan:
- Many other options available in Scikit-learn ensemble methods e.g. voting classifier/regressor or stacking models to reduce biases
- ?Likely using same dataset from series 2.1
- ?possibly one post only
- Scikit-learn RandomForestRegressor()
- array X (no. of samples, no. of features) vs. array y (no. of samples or target values)
- Parameter tuning likely needed
- Plots
- Black-box ML (unlike white-box ML for decision tree)

#### **Machine learning series 2.2 - Random forest**

This repository will hold most of the files used in relation to random forest, which is another commonly used machine learning (ML) algorithm in the field of drug discovery. I'm still going to try and use a deeper-dive style to explore it this time so it will take some time.

##### **Dataset**

It's likely going to be on the same set of data derived from ML series 2.1 (decision tree), unless other data would be better suited (depending on availabilities as I'm focusing on open-source data only). 

##### **Project status**

This project is part of the tree models ML series, and is currently at the planning or work-in-progress stage, with an estimated time of arrival in November or December 2023 (to be presented as a blog post).

#### **Machine learning series 2.2 - Random forest**

This repository currently holds most of the files used in this random forest (RF) project. RF is another commonly used machine learning (ML) algorithm in drug discovery. I've attempted to use a deeper-dive style to explore it this time, but there were actually a lot of things to be covered, so the final post was not completely comprehensive, but it'd be a snapshot of how I approached it when I worked on it prior to the published date. The blog post is currently available [here](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/17_ML2-2_Random_forest/1_random_forest.html) or you can read it from my blog at https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/. Jupyter notebook version of the project is available above (file name: 1_random_forest.ipynb). This work was run in a virtual environment of Python 3.10.

##### **Dataset**

The same set of data derived from ML series 2.1 (decision tree) was used. For details about how I've derived this dataset, please visit series 2.1 posts [1](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/16_ML2-1_Decision_tree/1_data_col_prep.html) and [2](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/16_ML2-1_Decision_tree/2_data_prep_tran.html).

#### **Machine learning series 2.2 - Random forest**

This repository will hold most of the files used in relation to random forest, which is another commonly used machine learning (ML) algorithm in the field of drug discovery. I'm still going to try and use a deeper-dive style to explore it this time so it will take some time.

##### **Dataset**

The same set of data derived from ML series 2.1 (decision tree) was used. For details about how I've derived this dataset, please visit series 2.1 posts [1](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/16_ML2-1_Decision_tree/1_data_col_prep.html) and [2](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/16_ML2-1_Decision_tree/2_data_prep_tran.html).

##### **Project status**

This project is part of the tree model series, and is currently at the researching, coding and writing stage, with an estimated time of arrival in November to December 2023. The final presentation format will be a blog post, which I'll try to keep it to one post only this time. While I'm working on this currently, I realise that there are a lot of things to be covered so it will not be completely comprehensive, but it'll be a snapshot of how I approached it at this particular period.

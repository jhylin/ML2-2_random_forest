#### **Machine learning series 2.2 - Random forest**

This repository will hold most of the files used in relation to random forest, which is another commonly used machine learning (ML) technique in the field of drug discovery. Currently, it's likely going to be on the same set of data derived in ML series 2.1. This project is part of the tree models ML series, and is currently at the planning or work-in-progress stage, with an estimated time of arrival (to be presented as a blog post) in October or November at the moment (unless circumstances change).

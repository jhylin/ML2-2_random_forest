##### **Brief introduction**

This post is an addition towards the last post on random forest (RF), machine learning (ML) series 2.2, and was mainly inspired by the paper (cite Esposito et al. on ghostml) from this lab group, [rinikerlab](https://github.com/rinikerlab). When I started reading the paper, I felt that I should complete the random forest series by adding a random forest classifier model since the last post was only using a regressor. The other thing was that imbalanced datasets were a common problem in drug discovery projects, and as part of my steep learning curve, I should do something about it, so that was why this post exists. I also decided not to go over too much on the origins of imbalanced datasets in drug discovery as this paper has covered it quite thoroughly. I'm also aiming to make this post shorter than the last one (however, every time I sat down writing a post thinking that I should make it shorter, it always turns out to be longer than expected).

##### **The plan**

*Something new - chembl_downloader & GHOST paper*

* Data source
- using chembl_downloader to get new dataset (minor cleaning/preprocessing as focus is on dealing with imbalanced datasets in RF classifier)
    - data source thoroughness (ChEMBL version, reproducible data source workflow)
    - AChE as target, drug indication notebook as ref - max_phase_for_ind

chembl_downloader reference notebooks:
- https://github.com/cthoyt/chembl-downloader/blob/main/notebooks/drug-indications.ipynb (main reference)
- https://github.com/PatWalters/practical_cheminformatics_tutorials/blob/1f7c61f83eec81081ef2605ac70440bf1940d914/misc/working_with_ChEMBL_drug_data.ipynb#L80 (full download of a specific version of ChEMBL)
- https://github.com/iwatobipen/playground/blob/9970ab174cd87e4487390abab9a9ae4b80f0288f/make_peptide.ipynb#L12

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import chembl_downloader
from chembl_downloader import latest, queries, query
```

```{python}
# Show the latest version of ChEMBL used
latest_version = latest()

print(f"The latest ChEMBL version is: {latest_version}")
```

```{python}
# Query chembl_downloader to show SQL required to extract ChEMBL data for a specific protein target
# target_chembl_id for AChE: CHEMBL220
queries.markdown(queries.get_target_sql(target_id="CHEMBL220"))
```

```{python}
# Following data download works (4.41GB for SQL query below, may take several min), need to add max phase SQL so can show max_phase for each compound

sql = """
sql
SELECT
    ASSAYS.chembl_id              AS assay_chembl_id,
    TARGET_DICTIONARY.target_type,
    TARGET_DICTIONARY.tax_id,
    COMPOUND_STRUCTURES.canonical_smiles,
    MOLECULE_DICTIONARY.chembl_id AS molecule_chembl_id,
    ACTIVITIES.standard_type,
    ACTIVITIES.pchembl_value
FROM TARGET_DICTIONARY
     JOIN ASSAYS ON TARGET_DICTIONARY.tid == ASSAYS.tid
     JOIN ACTIVITIES ON ASSAYS.assay_id == ACTIVITIES.assay_id
     JOIN MOLECULE_DICTIONARY ON MOLECULE_DICTIONARY.molregno == ACTIVITIES.molregno
     JOIN COMPOUND_STRUCTURES ON MOLECULE_DICTIONARY.molregno == COMPOUND_STRUCTURES.molregno
WHERE TARGET_DICTIONARY.chembl_id = 'CHEMBL220'
    AND ACTIVITIES.pchembl_value IS NOT NULL
"""

df = chembl_downloader.query(sql)
df.head()
```





* Model building
- re-label max phases as binary labels (max phase null/0, max phase 4/1)

- 2 approaches from GHOST paper (main idea was on shifting decision threshold)
    - approach 1 based on RDKit blog post (ref. 41)
    - approach 2 led to Generalised threshold shifting (GHOST) procedure - ghostml code

- RandomForestClassifier() from scikit-learn

* Visualisations
- ?feature importances or others

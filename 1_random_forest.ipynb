        "\n",
        "The [decision tree model built last time](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/16_ML2-1_Decision_tree/3_model_build.html) was purely based on one model on its own, which often might not be as accurate or reflective in real-life. To improve the model, the average outcome from multiple models [@breiman1998] should be considered to see if this would provide a more realistic image. This model averaging approach was also constantly used in our daily lives, for example, using majority votes during decision-making steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "The same model averaging concept was also used in random forest [@breiman2001], which as the name suggested, was composed of many decision trees (models) forming a forest. Each tree model would be making its own model prediction. By accruing multiple predictions since we have multiple trees, the average obtained from these predictions would produce one single result in the end. The advantage of this was that it improved the accuracy of the prediction by reducing variances, and also minimised the problem of overfitting the model if it was purely based on one model only (more details in section 1.11.2.1. Random Forests from [*scikit-learn*](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#random-forests)).\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"random\" part of the random forest was introduced in two ways. The first one was via using bootstrap samples, which was also known as bagging or bootstrap aggregating [@bruce2020], where samples were drawn with replacements within the training datasets for each tree built in the ensemble (also known as the perturb-and-combine technique [@breiman1998]). While bootstrap sampling was happening, randomness was also incorporated into the training sets at the same time. The second way randomness was introduced was by using a random subset of features for splitting at the nodes, or a full set of features could also be used (although this was generally not recommended). The main goal here was to achieve best splits at each node.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Random forest in *scikit-learn***\n",
        "\n",
        "*Scikit-learn* had two main types of random forest classes - [ensemble.RandomForestClassifier()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html#sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier) and [ensemble.RandomForestRegressor()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html#sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor). When to use which class would depend on the target values. The easiest thing to do was to decide whether the target variables had class labels (binary types or non-continuous variables e.g. yes or no, or other different categories to be assigned) or continuous (numerical) variables, which in this case, if I were to continue using the same dataset from the decision tree series, it would be a continuous variable or feature, pKi, the inhibition constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "There were also two other alternative random forest methods in *scikit-learn*, which were ensemble.RandomTreesEmbedding() and ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier() or ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor(). The difference for RandomTreesEmbedding() was that it was an unsupervised method that used data transformations (more details from section 1.11.2.6. on \"Totally Random Trees Embedding\" in [*scikit-learn*](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#totally-random-trees-embedding)). On the other side, there was also an option to use ExtraTreesClassifier() or ExtraTreesRegressor() to generate extremely randomised trees that would go for another level up in randomness (more deatils in section 1.11.2.2. on Extremely Randomized Trees from [*scikit-learn*](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#extremely-randomized-trees)). The main difference for this type of random forest was that while there was already a random subset of feature selection used (with an intention to select the most discerning features), more randomness were added on top of this by using purely randomly generated splitting rules for picking features at the nodes. The advantage of this type of method was that it would reduce variance and increase the accuracy of the model, but the downside was there might be an increase in bias within the model.\n",

        "I didn't really pay a lot of attentions when I was doing data splits in the decision tree series, as my main focus was on building a single tree in order to fully understand and see what could be derived from just one tree. Now, when I reached this series on random forest, I realised I forgot to mention in the last series that data splitting was actually very crucial on model performance and could influence outcome predictions. It could also become quite complicated as more approaches were available to split the data. Also, the way the data was splitted could produce different outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "After I've splitted the same dataset based on compounds' max phase assignments in ChEMBL and also fitted the training data on the random forest regressor, I went back and noticed that the training and testing data were very imbalanced and I probably should do something about it before fitting them onto another model.\n",
        "\n",
        "At this stage, I went further to look into whether imbalanced datasets should be addressed in regression tasks, and did a surface search online. So based on common ML concensus, addressing imbalanced datasets were more applicable to classification tasks (e.g. binary labels or multi-class labels), rather than regression problems. However, recent ML research looked into the issue of imbalanced datasets in regression. This [blog post](https://neptune.ai/blog/how-to-deal-with-imbalanced-classification-and-regression-data) mentioned a few studies that looked into this type of problem, and I thought they were very interesting and worth a mention at least. One of them that I've looked into was SMOTER, which was based on synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE)[@chawla2002], and was named this way because it was basically a SMOTE for regression (hence SMOTER)[@torgo2013]. Synthetic minority over-sampling technique for regression with Gaussian noise (SMOGN)[@smogn] was another technique that was built upon SMOTER, but with Gaussian noises added. This has subsequently led me to ImbalancedLearningRegression library [@wu2022imbalancedlearningregression], which was a variation of SMOGN. This was the one used on my imbalanced dataset, shown in the section below.\n",

        "Random forest was known to be a black-box ML algorithm [@bruce2020], which was completely different from the white-box ML style revealed in decision tree graphs. Feature importances was therefore crucial to shed some lights and remove some layers of the black-box nature in random forest by showing which features were contributing towards model accuracy by ranking features used to train the model. Cross-validation was also vital to avoid over-fitting (which was more applicable to depth of trees), although in some other cases (e.g. number of trees), it was mentioned that it was unlikely the model would be overfitted. Other options available in *scikit-learn* ensemble methods that I didn't get time to try were using voting classifier/regressor and stacking models to reduce biases in models, which might be very useful in other cases.\n",

        "Few things I've thought of that I could try to improve what I did here was that I should really look for a different set of testing data, rather than using the max phase splits, which was not that ideal. However, as a lot of us are aware, good drug discovery data are hard to come by (a long-standing and complicated problem), I probably need some luck while looking for a different set of drug discovery data later. Another approach that I could try was that I could use RandomForestClassifier() instead on max phase prediction of these small molecules, rather than making pKi value predictions. This might involve re-labelling the max phases for these compounds into a binary or class labels, then I could use the imbalance-learn package to try and alleviate the problem with imbalanced datasets. Nevertheless, I had some fun working on this post and learnt a lot while doing it, and I hope some of the readers might find this post helpful or informative at least.\n",
